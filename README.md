In this video, I'll be showing you how to create an Instagram Scraping API in Node.js. We'll focus on building the API component, and to keep things streamlined, we won't dive into the details of coding the frontend. However, I'll provide a working demonstration of the API so that you can see for yourself that it's functioning correctly. So let's dive right in!

This video is for educational purposes only. Please note that Instagram does not allow scraping their API, and doing so may violate their terms of service.
